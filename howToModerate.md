## What is issue moderation? 

When people create new issues, they have no labels, and no milestones:

*Labels* are "tags" placed on tickets to help classificate the issues , both in the skills involved to solve it, and in effort estimation.

*Milestones* are correlated to "release planning": they tell roughly when an issue / idea must be implemented , and when it is to be properly released.

The development team may have to dedicate a significant time watching all the incoming issues... 

We need people that:

* Read new issues and assign them to proper milestones;

* Check if issues have enough upvotes to be planned ;

* Check if the issue is a duplicate of another issue , and , if that is so, proper provide feedback to the issue opener about that.
