## Welcome to the Civilization IV: Colonization Mod "We the People" !

This is a community empowered mod that is based on the [Religion and Revolution Mod](https://sourceforge.net/projects/religion-and-revolution-git/) . Everyone is welcome to contribute:

* *As a developer*: all our development tasks are placed as "issues". You may check them out here: TODO
* *As a player*: please check the ideas LINK HERE and upvote / downvote them (for that , you will need to register to github).
* *As an issue moderator*: we need people to help us triage the issues: identify if the issue is a duplicate, and then add them to proper milestones. Also, to identify ideas that have enough approvals for being planned into production.
