## Welcome to the Civilization IV: Colonization Mod "We the People" !

This is a community empowered mod that is based on the [Religion and Revolution Mod](https://sourceforge.net/projects/religion-and-revolution-git/) . Everyone is welcome to contribute:

* *As a developer*: all our development tasks are placed as "issues". Most of them are mainly code issues, but there are some that can be solved only with xml tampering. We may also have demands for graphic artists. You may check them out [at the Mod/Issues page](https://github.com/We-the-People-civ4col-mod/Mod/issues)

* *As a player*: 
  * please check the [ideas](https://github.com/We-the-People-civ4col-mod/Mod/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3AIDEA) and upvote / downvote them (for that , you will need to register to github).
  * Also, be welcome to report new issues and your ideas! 

* *As an issue moderator*: we need people to help us triage the issues: identify if the issue is a duplicate, and then add them to proper milestones. Also, to identify ideas that have enough approvals for being planned into production. [More details...](howToModerate.md)

* *As a web-designer* : currently the team is composed mostly of developer nerds that aren't very good with graphic design... This site could certainly use some care ... :)
