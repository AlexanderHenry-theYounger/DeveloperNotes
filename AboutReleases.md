### About beta releases:

For beta releases the default CvGameCoreDLL.dll found in the Assets directory is the  "2 plots assert" mode: this means that it is a bit slower than release, but it shows bugs, helping us to solve new issues as they come by. 

If you think that a little more speed is more important than to help us ironing bugs you can change the dll at the "Assets" folder to the one found at the '2 city plot/release' folder. 

If you prefer the '1 city plot' option, the same option as before goes: just copy the dll from the "1 city plot/assert" directory and place it into the "Assets" folder.

If you see some crazy messages out there, check if it isn't a known issue here: https://github.com/We-the-People-civ4col-mod/Mod/wiki/List-of-common-assertions . If you have found a new one, please open a new issue, and kindly provide us the save from immediately before the issue happened.

This release is still save-compatible with the Religion and Revolution Mod, v2.7 ... just unzip the contents of the "We-the-People.zip" directly into the "Religions and Revolutions" mod and you should be able to play the new version with no issues...

You can also see "debug" versions at the "1 city plot" and "2 city plot
